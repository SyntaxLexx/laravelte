            <p>Laravel Actions is one of those things you didn't know you needed till you used it.</p>
            <p>
                The mindset shits focus from thinking about controllers, and instead become more <strong
                    >intimate</strong
                > with your application functionality
            </p>
            <br />
            <blockquote>
                we shift our focus from "What controllers do I need?", "should I make a FormRequest for this?", "should
                this run asynchronously in a job instead?", etc.
            </blockquote>
            <p class="my-4">to</p>
            <blockquote>"What does my application actually do?" Kinda like RPC</blockquote>
            <p class="mt-8">
                However, we don't go full gun-blazing by taking all the principles outlined by the <a
                    href="https://laravelactions.com/"
                    target="_blank">Author of the application.</a
                >
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>Instead,</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-8">
                <li>Complex FormRequests</li>
                <li>Jobs</li>
                <li>Events</li>
                <li>Listeners</li>
                <li>Commands</li>
                <li>Middlewares</li>
                <li>e.t.c</li>
            </ul>
            <p>are left as per their defaults.</p>
            <p>
                Actions are - technically, <strong>Controllers!</strong>. They handle most of the logic (view them as
                kind of like-components), dispatch jobs, fire events, validate requests, e.t.c. This approach ensures
                <strong>easier Maintainability</strong> and no <strong>mental fatigue</strong> in the long run.
